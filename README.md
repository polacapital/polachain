**PolaChain README**

**Introduction:**
Welcome to PolaChain, a dummy blockchain designed for educational and testing purposes. PolaChain provides a simplified environment for understanding the fundamental concepts of blockchain technology and experimenting with various blockchain functionalities.

**Features:**
1. **Simplified Blockchain:** PolaChain implements a simplified version of a blockchain network, consisting of blocks linked together using cryptographic hashes. Users can explore how blocks are created, validated, and added to the blockchain.

2. **Proof of Work (PoW):** PolaChain utilizes a basic Proof of Work consensus mechanism to secure the network and prevent malicious activities such as double-spending. Users can observe how PoW mining works and its role in maintaining the integrity of the blockchain.

3. **Transaction Simulation:** Users can simulate transactions within the PolaChain network to understand how data is stored on the blockchain and how transactions are processed and verified.

4. **Wallet Management:** PolaChain includes basic wallet functionality, allowing users to create and manage wallets for sending and receiving digital assets (tokens) within the network.

5. **API Documentation:** Detailed documentation is provided for developers interested in exploring PolaChain's functionalities through APIs. This includes endpoints for interacting with the blockchain, managing wallets, and more.

**Getting Started:**
To get started with PolaChain, follow these steps:
1. Clone the PolaChain repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/polachain).
